This is a minimal Python wrapper around the App Center REST APIs to get you up and running. If you are looking for something more substantial, please refer to the REST API documentation: https://openapi.appcenter.ms/

You can install with `pip install appcenter`

## Usage

```python
# 1. Import the library
import appcenter

# 2. Create a new client
client = appcenter.AppCenterClient(access_token="abc123def456")

# 3. Check some error groups
start = datetime.datetime.now() - datetime.timedelta(days=10)
for group in client.crashes.get_error_groups(org_name="org", app_name="myapp", start_time=start):
    print(group.errorGroupId)

# 4. Get recent versions
for version in client.versions.all(org_name="org", app_name="myapp"):
    print(version)

# 5. Create a new release
client.versions.upload_and_release(
    org_name="org",
    app_name="myapp",
    version="0.1",
    build_number="123",
    binary_path="/path/to/some.ipa",
    group_id="12345678-abcd-9012-efgh-345678901234",
    release_notes="These are some release notes",
    branch_name="test_branch",
    commit_hash="1234567890123456789012345678901234567890",
    commit_message="This is a commit message"
)
```
